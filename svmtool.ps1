	Note that new snapmirrors will of course still be created
.PARAMETER NoSnapmirrorWait

    Must be used together with TemporarySecondaryCifsIp
.PARAMETER SecondaryCifsLifCustomVlan
    For cifs, sometimes a secondary lif is needed to join in Active Directory (duplicate ip conflict)
    We use the SecondaryCifsLifMaster to clone a new temp lif, however with this parameter you can override the vlan
    to which this Temp lif is bound.
    Must be used together with TemporarySecondaryCifsIp and SecondaryCifsLifMaster 
.PARAMETER ActiveDirectoryCustomOU
    When joining a DR Cifs vserver in AD, you can override the target OU with this parameter.

.EXAMPLE
    svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Setup

    Create a new instance named test
.EXAMPLE
    svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -ConfigureDR [-XDPPolicy <policy name>]

    Configure a SVM DR relationship for SVM svm_source in the instance test
    And create all necessary DR objects
.EXAMPLE
    svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -ConfigureDR -AlwaysChooseDataAggr -SelectVolume

    Configure a SVM DR relationship for SVM svm_source in the instance test
    Request user to select which volume will be replicated and which not
    Ask for each volume on which destination aggregate it will be provisionned
.EXAMPLE
   svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -UpdateDR
   
   Set and Update all data and metadata for the DR SVM associated with source SVM svm_source
.EXAMPLE
    svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -ActivateDR
    
	Activate the DR SVM associated with source SVM svm_source
	Snapshot Policy on destination volume will not beeing updated
    Access will be allowed on DR SVM
.EXAMPLE
    svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -ResyncReverse
    
    Following an ActivateDR, create a reverse SnapMirror relationship from DR to source and erase data only on source SVM
.EXAMPLE
    svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -UpdateReverse

    Following a ResyncReverse, push all metadata modifications achieved on DR SVM to source SVM
.EXAMPLE
    svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -ReActivate

	Following an ActivateDR, restart production on source SVM
.EXAMPLE
	svmtools.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver source_svm -ShowDR [-Schedule] [-Lag]

	Display status and details of source SVM object and destination SVM object, as well as all SnapMirror relatiohships
	Use color to display destination volume different from source
	With option -Schedule, it also display SnapMirror schedule that is set
	With option -Lag, it also display SnapMirror Lag
.EXAMPLE
	svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -Migrate -ForceUpdateSnapPolicy

	Following successful ConfigureDR and UpdateDR, Migrate an SVM to destination cluster
	During this step, you will be prompt to delete or not source SVM and all its objects
	If not deleted, source SVM is stopped
	Once Migration is done, destination SVM gain source identity
	Temporary IP address are replaced by source IP address and CIFS server identity is changed with source name
.EXAMPLE
	svmtool.ps1 -Instance test -Vserver svm_source -DeleteSource
	
	When Migrate is performed without deleting source SVM, you can choose (when ready)
	to delete source SVM by using -DeleteSource option
	During this step, SVM name on destination Cluster will be renamed with source name
	And all objects of source SVM, and source SVM itself will be destroyed
.EXAMPLE
	svmtool.ps1 -Backup clusterA [-Vserver <svm name>]

	Backup all SVM on clusterA.
	If Backup&Restore Instance associated to clusterA does not exist, the script will create it.
	All SVM will be backed up in separate folder inside the directory chosen for this instance
	If you want to recreate the instance for clusterA, add -Recreateconf
	If you want to only Backup a particular SVM, add -Vserver <svm name>
.EXAMPLE
	svmtool.ps1 -Restore clusterA [-Vserver <svm name>] -Destination clusterB [-RW] [-SelectBackupDate] 

	Restore all SVM available from the Backup folder defined in the clusterA Backup&Restore instance to clusterB
	If you need to restore a particular SVM, just -add -Vserver <svm name>
	By default, the script will automaticaly restore from the most recent backup folder available for each SVM
	If you want to restore from a particular date, just add -SelectBackupDate, and the script will display all dates available
	for each SVM and prompt you to chose the date you want
	By default, the script restore all volume as Data-Protection type (DP) volume. 
	In order to allow you to restore data inside this volumes from a SnapMirror/SnapVault previous backup.
	If you don't have a SnapMirror/SnapVault backup or will restore data back with another method,
	or because you only need to recreate the "envelop" fo the SVM (to clone an environment by example), just add -RW to the command line
	In that case, all volumes will be restored as Read/Write (RW) volume.
.EXAMPLE
	svmtool.ps1 -Instance <instance name> -Vserver <vserver source name> -CloneDR [-DataAggr <default data aggregate name>] [-RootAggr] [-DefaultPass]

	Create a temporary Clone Vserver on destination cluster
	Clone all destinations volumes (DP) into this cloned vserver as Read/Write volume (RW)
	In order, to perform/test the DR without interrupting Snapmirror relationship during the timeframe of the DR test
	It could also be used to provision an cloned environment of production SVM on destination cluster for test/dev
	Once cloned environment successfully done, all volumes are Flexclone volumes attached to destinations volumes through lastest snapshot available
	If needed, this cloned environment and all its volumes could be split from destination vserver : see SplitCloneDR option
	With the optional arugment -SelectVolume, you could choose which volume will be cloned in the temporay Cloned SVM
.EXAMPLE
	svmtool.ps1 -Instance <instance name> -Vserver <vserver source name> -DeleteCloneDR -CloneName PSLAB_DR_clone.2

	Completely delete Vserver Clone named PSLAB_DR_clone.2 from secondary cluster
.EXAMPLE
	To enable encryption on destination volume you need:
	
		. Upgrade PowerShell ToolKit (PSTK) to version 4.7 minimum (NaToolkitVersion 4.5 minimum)
		. Destination Cluster must run at least ONTAP 9.1
		. Destination Cluster must run at least ONTAP 9.3 if you want to convert existing destination volumes into encrypted volumes
		. You must modify your instance configuration by running
			.\svmtool.ps1 -Setup <Instance Name> -Vserver <SVM Name>
			or
			New-SvmDrConfiguration -Instance <Instance Name> -Vserver <SVM Name>

			And answer yes to the question to enable encryption
		. Once instance modified, all new volumes will be automatically encyrpted on destination
		. If you already have unencrypted volumes on destination, you can choose to encrypt them by running:
			.\svmtool.ps1 -Instance <Instance Name> -Vserver <SVM Name> -ConfiguredDR
			or
			New-SvmDr -Instance <Instance Name> -Vserver <SVM Name>

            You will then be prompted to choose to encrypt volume by volume, all volumes or no volume
.EXAMPLE
    svmtool.ps1 -Instance <instance name> -Vserver <vserver source name> [-ConfigureDR|-UpdateDR] -XDPPolicy <policy name>
    
    You can change existing Policy of all snapmirror relationships by running ConfigureDR or UpdateDR with XDPpolicy argument
    The chosen policy must already exist on destination Cluster
